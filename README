The initial setup was made using python in jupyter notebook and the 596 particles are stored in the init.out file.

The mice_leaper.c takes the init.out file and returns out.dat file that contains a format that is equivalent to the aarseth one. 

I've attached various gifs of the simulation at different views and  different velocities.
